**Deep Learning Specialization**   
[*<font color="#ff6633">[Deep Learning]</font>*](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/ELLF6SH732TL) [*<font color="#ff6633">[DL Notes]</font>*](https://github.com/omar-sharif03/Deep-Learning-Notes) [(Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

   * Get the foundations of deep learning and learn about CNN, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization and other hyper-parameter optimization techniques which help me to build successful deep learning projects.
   * Implement different case studies on autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing using tensorflow and python.
          
**DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization**  
[*<font color="#ff6633">[TensorFlow]</font>*](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/5E2FDBG5ALDR) [(Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
  * Built basic neural network, GRUs, LSTMs using tensorflow and get profound implementation knowledge of tensorflow.
  * Learned how to improve network performance using convolutions, how to teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems.

**Natural Language Processing Specialization**  
[*<font color="#ff6633">[Enrolled]</font>*](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing?)
   * Will learn about recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs & Siamese network in TensorFlow & Trax for sentiment analysis, text generation & named entity recognition.
   * Will apply encoder-decoder & self-attention to machine translate complete sentences, summarize text, build chatbots & question-answering.
